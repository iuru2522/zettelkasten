Validation

Validation is an automatic check to ensure that data entered is sensible and feasible.
Validation cannot ensure data is accurate.
When programming, it is important that you include validation for data inputs. This stops unexpected or abnormal data from crashing your program and prevents you from receiving impossible garbage outputs.
